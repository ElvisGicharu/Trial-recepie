    <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. 
        I sized the recipe for one serving, 
        but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. 
        It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. 
        Be careful when drinking it, however. 
        If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing
         yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no
          time!</p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
          <li>½ medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divide</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
          <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>
          <li>1½ fluid ounces white rum</li>
          <li>½ cup club soda, or as needed</li>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
            <li>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
            <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice. Pour in rum and fill the glass with club soda.</li>
            <li>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Cook's Note:</h5>
          <p>Tonic water can be used instead of club soda but the taste will be different and somewhat bitter.</p>
